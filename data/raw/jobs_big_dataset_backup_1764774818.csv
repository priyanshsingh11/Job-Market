ABOUT THE ROLE:

We’re looking for a data-pro who can turn scattered information into sharp, actionable intelligence. Someone who enjoys connecting sales, marketing, supply chain, and customer behavior into one clean storyline — and can tell you what happened, why it happened, and what to do next.

This role directly influences marketing efficiency, revenue growth, supply chain planning, and website performance.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. Business Intelligence & Daily Analytics
• Consolidate SKU-wise daily sales, spends, ROAS, supply chain fill rates, and availability data across all channels.
• Build unified dashboards that merge all these layers into a single view of truth.
• Use AI to automate insights, detect anomalies, and generate predictive commentary.

2. Root-Cause Diagnosis Across Functions
• Investigate business dips or changes and correlate multiple data streams to explain them.
• Example: If sales drop on a specific channel or SKU, break it down into:
• marketing spends → performance campaigns → traffic & CVR → availability → fill rate → dispatch delays → competition trends.
• Provide a clear narrative of what happened and why — and recommend actionable next steps.

3. Predictive Analytics & Stock Planning
• Build models to forecast demand, project stock requirement, and predict potential stockouts based on sales trends, seasonality, campaign plans, and category velocity.
• Help the supply planning team prepare accurate input planning and replenishment cycles.
• Flag risk zones early — possible OOS, aging inventory, slow movers, or demand spikes.

4. Marketing & Performance Optimization
• Analyze spends across Google, Meta, WhatsApp and identify leakages, inefficiencies, and opportunity losses.
• Build clear insights that connect marketing inputs to business outcomes.
• Identify experiments, measure results, and communicate insights simply and impactfully.

5. D2C Funnel & Website Journey Analytics
• Map and improve full funnel behavior from ads → landing page → add-to-cart → checkout → repeat.
• Identify friction points and work with product/dev teams to increase CVR and reduce drop-offs.
• Build cohorts, LTV models, retention triggers, and customer segments.

6. Tooling, Automation & Advanced Analytics
• Build automated reporting pipelines via SQL, Python/R, and dashboarding tools like Looker, Power BI, Tableau.
• Integrate multiple data sources (CRM, website analytics, marketing platforms, platform APIs).
• Use AI tools to increase speed, accuracy, and decision-making quality.

MUST HAVE SKILL:
• Solid in SQL, Python/R (bonus), Excel, GA4, Meta/Google dashboards, and BI tools.
• 3–6 years in data analytics within ecommerce, D2C, FMCG, or consumer internet.
• Strong understanding of performance marketing metrics, funnel analytics, and attribution.
• Experience with ecommerce/D2C platforms and multi-source data correlation.
• Ability to convert insights into clear business actions, not just reports.
• Experience forecasting demand, analyzing availability, and working with supply chain metrics.
• A mindset of investigation, experimentation, and continuous optimization.

NICE TO HAVE SKILLS
• Knowledge of CDPs (WebEngage, Clevertap, MoEngage).
• Basic understanding of API integrations and automation scripts.
• Experience with predictive models and time-series forecasting.

• Orchestration : Schedule jobs with Airflow / Prefect; manage dependencies, SLAs, retries; design backfills and incremental loads.
• Observability : Implement DQ checks (Great Expectations / dbt tests), model performance & drift monitoring, alerting, and cost guardrails.
• Activation & APIs : Ship fast, robust services (FastAPI / Cloud Functions) to push signals into Meta CAPI, Google Ads (EC / OCI), TikTok Events API or via reverse ETL (Hightouch / Census).
• Experimentation & measurement : Partner with product / GTM on uplift tests, holdouts, and calibration to prove incremental value.
• Docs & enablement : Produce crisp runbooks, ERDs, and playbooks; teach others to self‑serve.

30
• 60
• 90 day outcomes
• 30 days : Audit current data + tracking; publish V1 tracking plan & data model; baseline pLTV / propensity notebook and EDA; quick wins on data reliability.
• 60 days : Production warehouse models (dbt) + orchestrated pipelines; first model in staging with offline / online validation; reverse ETL wired for a design partner.
• 90 days : v1 serving in prod with monitoring; value‑based bidding pilot live in Google / Meta for 2+ partners; dashboarding for KPIs and model health; draft case study.

You’ll be great at this if you
• Have 7-10+ years shipping DS / ML systems to production (not just notebooks).
• Are fluent in Python, SQL , and one major cloud ( GCP / AWS ), with BigQuery / Snowflake and dbt experience.
• Know MLOps (MLflow / Weights & Biases, Feast / feature store, Docker / K8s, CI / CD) and orchestration (Airflow / Prefect).
• Can design measurement plans and communicate trade‑offs with clarity.
• Thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and own outcomes end‑to‑end.

Nice to Have :
• Streaming (Pub / Sub / Kafka), privacy / consent (Consent Mode v2, GDPR / CCPA), clean rooms (ADH / Meta), Shopify / subscription analytics.

Why AdZeta?

AI/ML Engineer - Search Location: Remote-Pune | Full-Time

At Evolphin, we’re redefining how creative teams search, manage, and collaborate on content. While most companies apply AI to text, we’ve gone further: our platform embeds and indexes actual media files — video, image, design, and audio — enabling true semantic search across time-coded content and millions of creative assets. Our flagship platform, Zoom MAM, is trusted by global broadcasters, agencies, and top brands including Inter MIlan FC, Merck, Mercedes Benz to power their visual workflows. We’re now rebuilding our metadata and search architecture from the ground up — using Python-based LLM pipelines, vector embeddings, and a high-performance object store designed for AI-native media search. This isn’t just “chat with your documents.” It’s AI that understands a scene, shot, logo, or layout — and finds the right clip, version, or layout at the speed of thought.

What You’ll Own
• Build and extend backend services that power AI-driven media search and metadata enrichment
• Develop, integrate, and deploy AI/ML inference pipelines (embeddings, vision/audio models, transcription, background removal, etc.)
• Fine-tune and optimize computer vision and generative models (e.g., U²Net, BiRefNet, CLIP, Whisper, YOLO, diffusion models)
• Work with large datasets (100k–5M images): preprocessing, augmenting, and structuring for training/inference
• Contribute to building pipelines for tasks like background removal, inpainting/outpainting, banner generation, logo/face detection, and multimodal embeddings
• Integrate with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) for similarity and semantic search
• Collaborate with the engineering team to deploy scalable AI inference endpoints (Docker + GPU/EC2/SageMaker) Skills & Experience We Expect (2–3 Years)
• Core Python (Required) – solid programming and debugging skills in production systems
• AI/ML Libraries – hands-on experience with PyTorch and/or TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, Hugging Face Transformers
• Model Training/Fine-Tuning – experience fine-tuning pre-trained models for vision, audio, or multimodal tasks
• Data Handling – preprocessing and augmenting image/video datasets for training and evaluation
• Vector Search – familiarity with FAISS, Pinecone, or similar for embeddings-based search
• Comfortable with chaining or orchestrating multimodal inference workflows (e.g., image + audio + OCR → unified embedding)

Bonus Points If You …
• Have worked with generative models (diffusion, inpainting, or outpainting)
• Understand large-scale media workflows (video, design files, time-coded metadata)
• Enjoy experimenting with new models and pushing them into production
• Care about making AI useful in real-world creative pipelines

At Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), we are building the next generation of AI applications that transform how enterprises get work done. One of our flagship initiatives is an intelligent, multi-agent system designed to help professionals across domains query data, generate insights, and automate workflows through natural language.

As part of the AI Applications team, you will design and build agentic systems that use LLMs to plan, reason, and take actions across complex software workflows. You will architect tool-using, multi-step agents, define outcomes and constraints, develop evaluation suites, and drive continuous self-correction loops. You will work at the intersection of backend engineering and applied ML, integrating LLMs, retrieval, enterprise data, and deterministic policy layers into safe, reliable agents that can autonomously perform real work. Engineers who think probabilistically, enjoy iterating on system behavior, and can diagnose and improve agent performance will excel in this role.

Minimum Qualifications
• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience.
• 3+ years of professional software development experience.
• Strong coding skills in Python, with the ability to work comfortably with LLM APIs and model outputs.
• Experience building backend services or orchestration layers that integrate with external APIs or tools.
• Ability to work with probabilistic model behavior, iterative loops, and multi-step workflows rather than only deterministic logic.
• Ability to evaluate, test, and refine system behavior based on runtime signals, logs, and feedback rather than static unit tests alone.

Preferred Qualifications
• Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related technical field.
• Experience building or integrating LLM-powered applications or agents.
• Familiarity with agent frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, or similar orchestration libraries.
• Understanding of agentic design patterns including planning, tool use, self-correction, and long-horizon workflows.
• Understanding of retrieval, embeddings, routing, and tool-calling mechanisms.
• Experience designing constraints, safety checks, or evaluation suites for agentic systems.
• Experience with cloud-native environments (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD).
• Interests or prior-work in long-horizon reasoning challenges

Responsibilities
• Design and build agentic workflows that enable LLMs to plan, reason, use tools, and take multi-step actions safely.
• Implement the APIs, services, and runtime layers that connect agents with enterprise data, retrieval systems, and deterministic policy checks.
• Work with product teams to define outcomes, constraints, and evaluation methods for autonomous agents operating in complex workflows.
• Ensure production reliability through strong observability, test harnesses, agent evaluation pipelines, and continuous refinement of agent behavior.
• Participate in design and code reviews, contributing to high-quality engineering practices and helping evolve the architecture for agent-first applications.

Work from office Experience: 4–8 years

About the Role

We’re looking for a BI Platform Engineer who can help us build and scale our Business Intelligence layer — enabling our clients to explore, analyze, and visualize data directly through interactive dashboards and analytics tools.

Unlike a traditional BI developer focused on one-off reports or charts, this role is about designing and implementing BI systems and infrastructure — from data integration to publication — that empower users to perform self-service analytics on top of datasets derived from uploaded documents and other data sources.

Key Responsibilities

•Design, develop, and deploy interactive BI dashboards and tools (Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, QuickSight, or similar) for client-facing use.

•Build self-service BI platforms that allow clients to explore and analyze datasets independently.

•Work as part of a cross-functional team (Backend, Data Engineering, Frontend), with strong engineering support

•Embed dashboards and analytics modules into our existing client-facing GUI, ensuring performance, usability, access control, and multi-tenant security.

•Retrieve and consume data from PostgreSQL or other relational databases, working with Data Engineers to define the datasets and transformations needed for analytical use cases.

•Ensure data governance, secure access, and consistency in BI deployments.

•Collaborate with UX and frontend teams to ensure a seamless client experience within the existing platform.

Required Skills & Experience

•Proven experience with at least one major BI platform (Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, QuickSight, or equivalent).

•Ability to write basic to intermediate SQL to query and explore data, with the understanding that heavy SQL, transformations, or pipeline creation will be handled by Data Engineers.

•Experience in embedding and publishing BI dashboards as part of web applications.

•Understanding of authentication, access control, and multi-tenant security in BI solutions.

•General understanding of data integration concepts (ETL/ELT)

•Comfortable working in production environments and deploying scalable BI solutions.

•Good communication and collaboration skills; ability to work with engineers, product managers, and client-facing teams.

Preferred

•Knowledge of Dimensional Modelling (Star/Snowflake schemas).

•Experience in data pipeline tools (e.g., Airflow, dbt, or similar). (We don‘ use any of those tools, as far as I know, and I‘m not a big fan of ‘bells and whistles‘-tools; our pipelines are pretty much built on plain vanilla SQL)

•Familiarity with embedding analytics via APIs or SDKs.

•Experience in SaaS / multi-tenant product environments.

•Some exposure to Python or Node.js for automation and data manipulation.

· Core competencies

o 1+ years in an analytical, data-focused role, ideally within fintech, financial services, or a high-velocity digital environment

o Advanced SQL skills and comfort working within modern data ecosystems (Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, Looker, etc.)

o Strong understanding of data modeling and data architecture principles, and the ability to work efficiently with large, complex datasets

o Exceptionally data-driven — you support recommendations with robust analysis, clear logic, and high-quality evidence

o High attention to detail, even amidst shifting priorities, ambiguity, and fast turnaround times
