📊 Job Market Intelligence (Work in Progress)

This project is an ongoing system that collects job listings, cleans the data, analyzes trends, and builds machine learning models to predict salaries and required skills.

So far, the project includes:

✔ Web Scraping

Collecting job data such as title, company, location, skills, posted date, and more.

✔ Data Cleaning & Processing

Handling missing values, extracting skills, fixing salary formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

✔ Initial Machine Learning

Early experiments with models that predict average salary and extract important skills from job descriptions.

🚧 Work in Progress / Upcoming Features

Better feature engineering

Improved salary prediction model

Skill recommendation engine

API for real-time predictions

Power BI dashboard for insights

More robust scraping and larger dataset

💻 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, API Scrapping, Power BI

This repo will be updated continuously as the project grows.
Stay tuned! 🚀
